# Jobbr

By Jonathon Pemberton _<jonpemby@icloud.com>_

Search Google for job listings matching your criteria!

Backend script for a web app I'm writing. Eventually.

But you can use it now! Read on.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- Google Custom Search Engine
- Google API Key

## Usage

### Help

Simply type:

```
jobbr.py --help
```

And Jobbr will output a help menu!

### Searches

Currently a search is basically just a raw Google query.

You can use the same boolean search syntax you're used to, which is great.

However, Jobbr intends to include some powerful abstractions over this to keep you from having to write a lot of parameters.

For now, type in your queries like this:

```
jobbr.py "data scientist"
```

You'll see results printed out to the screen in JSON format.

Jobbr will include paged (and human readable) output coming soon.

## Configuration

You'll need a CX key and a Google API key.

Jobbr recommends using environment variables to store these but if you need to you can pass them as parameters like so:

```
jobbr.py "data scientist" --api-key=$(API_KEY) --cx=$(CX_KEY)
```

Or, you can store them as environment variables:

```
JOBBR_API_KEY=[key]
JOBBR_CX_KEY=[id]
```
